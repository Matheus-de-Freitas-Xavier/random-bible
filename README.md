## 🛠️ How to Run

**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

**Steps**
1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matheus-de-Freitas-Xavier/random-bible
```

2. **Naviguate to the folder**:
```bash
cd random-bible/
```
3. **Choose your preferred language and naviguate to the folder**:
```bash
cd English/
```
or
```bash
cd Brazilian_Portuguese/
```
3. **Run the script to create the file with list of chapters**:

Open your preferred terminal or IDE and run:

*(The example uses the English version, but if you are using the Portuguese version, copy the command below and change `EN` to `PT-BR`.)*
```bash
python3 Bible_txt_EN.py
```
4.  **Run the script to display a random chapter from the Bible and save it to another file**:

*(The example uses the English version, but if you are using the Portuguese version, copy the command below and change `EN` to `PT-BR`.)*
